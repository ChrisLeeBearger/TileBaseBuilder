## About

TileBaseBuilder is a 2D base building game created with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and is heavily inspired by games like [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/).

## Architecture

Game logic and presentation logic are separated from each other. On startup presentation layer registers callbacks on events of the game layer.
